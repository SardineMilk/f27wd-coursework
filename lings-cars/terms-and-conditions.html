      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
   
      <p>To be eligible for one of our offers you will need to be over the age of 18 and approved for credit with one of our agreed lenders. All offers are subject to availability and may be withdrawn at any time without prior notice. Information and prices are correct at the time of publishing which can be subject to change due to funders terms, dealer discounts or manufacturers terms.</p>

      <p>Failure to maintain payments may result in the termination of your contract agreement and the vehicle being returned to the funder. All vehicle images and descriptions are for illustration and reference purposes only. Please visit the manufacturer's website for more accurate specification. Terms and conditions apply.</p>

      <p>Please be aware that you do not own the vehicle at the end of the contract under a Business or Personal Contract Hire agreement. You are responsible for the condition of your vehicle, at the end of the lease, you may receive damage charges. These are extra fees that your finance provider may issue if necessary when your lease agreement ends. These charges will as a result of:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Damage to a vehicle outside of the BVRLA Fair Wear and Tear. A guide will normally be provided by your finance company. If not, one can be provided.</li>
        <li>Additional mileage over your agreed amount (also known as excess mileage)</li>
        <li>Returning your lease vehicle early (known as an early termination – please see below)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You are entitled to a 14 day cooling off period. For car leasing this usually starts from the day your contract has been signed and approved by the finance company. If you wish to cancel the order before you have received your lease car then you will need to send a written note of cancellation via email to sales@lingscars.com. Depending on the timeline of your order, you may be liable to pay a cancellation charge from the supplying dealership.</p>
      <p>On the day your car is to be delivered you are within your right to not accept the lease car if you are not satisfied with the car’s condition or if the specification of the car is not what was agreed on in the contract. This needs to be done whilst the delivery driver is still there, and nothing has been signed for. If you are unhappy with the car’s condition, you can get in contact with LINGsCARS, and we can speak to the supplier to help get any problems sorted. If you want to cancel the lease after you have received your vehicle this is then called an early termination. This is something that you would have to contact the finance company directly for as the contract is now live. The fees involved can be quite high, however there isn’t a set fee across each funder so this has to be discussed with the finance provider.</p>
