      <p>The Financial Conduct Authority is the independent regulator of financial services. The Financial Conduct Authority require us to provide you with a document called an 'Initial Disclosure Document'. This document provides information about us, the products we offer, the services we will provide, what we charge for our services, who regulates us, what to do if you have a complaint.</p>
     
      <h2>Who are we?</h2>

      <p>LINGsCARS.com Limited is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. FRN: 721481. We act as a credit broker not a lender.</p>

      <p>Our registered office is:</p>
      <p>15 Riverside Studios</p>
      <p>Newcastle Business Park</p>
      <p>Newcastle Upon Tyne</p>
      <p>NE4 7YL</p>

      <p>We are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Registered No: 721481</p>

      <p>As a Financial Conduct Authority regulated credit broker we can introduce you to a range of lenders who may be able to help you finance your vehicle and provide other products or services such as service packages or vehicle maintenance.</p>

      <h2>The expenses associated with our services, our compensation, and commission</h2>

      <p>As a licensed organization under the <b>Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</b>, our revenue is solely derived from commission and additional fees, such as our arrangement fee. The arrangement fee is associated with our services and is applied at the time of placing an order. This fee is designed to cover the expenses incurred by LINGsCARS.com, including facilitating the entire process from order placement to coordinating the delivery of your vehicle.</p>

      <p>Upon ordering a vehicle, you will enter into a lease agreement with one of our partner finance providers/lenders. We receive commission from the finance provider/lender once the agreement becomes active. While the commission may be pre-set, it can vary and will impact the amount payable by the customer. It's important to note that LINGsCARS.com operates as a broker, not a lender, and collaborates with multiple suppliers and/or funders.</p>

      <p>We charge a fee of <b>£225.00 inc VAT</b> for our Brokering Services.</p>

      <p>This is payable upon the ordering of the vehicle in one lump sum by bank transfer, or card payment via our lingo system</p>

      <p>You are entitled to a 14 day cooling off period. For car leasing this usually starts from the day your contract has been signed and approved by the finance company. If you wish to cancel the order before you have received your lease car then you will need to send a written note of cancellation via email to sales@lingscars.com. Depending on the timeline of your order, you may be liable to pay a cancellation charge from the supplying dealership.</p>

      <p>We may charge a fee for cancellation but this will be to the discretion of the supplier/dealer.</p>

      <p>(This does not affect your right to cancel your finance agreement within any cooling-off period, in accordance with the Distance Marketing Directive.)</p>

      <p>If you seek additional information regarding the disclosure of commission, please feel free to reach out via email at sales@lingscars.com</p>
