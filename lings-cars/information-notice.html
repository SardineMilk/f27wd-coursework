      <p>To proceed with brokering a vehicle contract hire/consumer credit finance request, we are obliged to bring the following information to your attention:</p>
      <p>We are LINGsCARS.com and our registered office is:</p>
      <p>15 Riverside Studios</p>
      <p>Newcastle Business Park</p>
      <p>Newcastle Upon Tyne</p>
      <p>NE4 7YL</p>

      <p>We are a broker of vehicle finance for regulated contract hire and consumer credit finance.</p>

      <p>We are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Registered No: 721481</p>

      <p>We are a broker, not a lender.</p>

      <h2>Charges and Cancellations</h2>

      <p>We charge a fee of <b>£225.00 inc VAT</b> for our Brokering Services.</p>
      <p>This is payable upon the ordering of the vehicle in one lump sum by bank transfer, or card payment via our lingo system</p>

      <p>You are entitled to a 14 day cooling off period. For car leasing this usually starts from the day your contract has been signed and approved by the finance company. If you wish to cancel the order before you have received your lease car then you will need to send a written note of cancellation via email to <a href="mailto:sales@lingscars.com">sales@lingscars.com</a> Depending on the timeline of your order, you may be liable to pay a cancellation charge from the supplying dealership.</p>

      <p>We may charge a fee for cancellation but this will be to the discretion of the supplier/dealer.</p>

      <p>(This does not affect your right to cancel your finance agreement within any cooling-off period, in accordance with the Distance Marketing Directive.)</p>
