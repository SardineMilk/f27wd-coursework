      <h1>Treating Customers Fairly</h1>
    
      <p>Our commitment is to deliver outstanding customer service while upholding the principle of treating you fairly. We maintain high standards in customer service and advice, recognizing your freedom to choose your service provider. Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) is a fundamental principle mandated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to guarantee fair treatment for customers. At LINGsCARS.com, we align with the FCA's six guiding principles, ensuring fair treatment in our interactions with customers, service levels, and the equity of our products, services, and procedures. The six principles are: </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Consumers can be confident that they are dealing with firms where the fair treatment of customers is central to the corporate culture.</li>
        <li>Products and services marketed and sold in the retail market are designed to meet the needs of identified consumer groups and are targeted accordingly.</li>
        <li>Consumers are provided with clear information and are kept appropriately informed before, during and after the point of sale.</li>
        <li>Where consumers receive advice, the advice is suitable and takes account of their circumstances.</li>
        <li>Consumers are provided with products that perform as firms have led them to expect, and the associated service is of an acceptable standard and as they have been led to expect.</li>
        <li>Consumers do not face unreasonable post-sale barriers imposed by firms to change product, switch provider, submit a claim or make a complaint.</li>
      </ol>
