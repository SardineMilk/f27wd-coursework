      <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
      <p>We are committed to providing you with a productive and privacy-friendly website experience, part of this functionality is facilitated through the use of cookies.</p>
     
      <p>Our website uses cookies.</p>

      <h2>What are cookies</h2>
      
      <p>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer (or other device such as mobile phone) if you agree. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>
     
      <p>Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. We use both session and persistent cookies on our website.</p>
     
      <p>Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user.</p>
     
      <p>Cookies can be used by web servers to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and identify users returning to a website.</p>
