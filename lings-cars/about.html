        <p class="staff-card-description">
            The founder of the company, Ling Valentine.
            Self-described as a "scruffy Chinese girl", Ling and her husband founded the company in 2000, and reported profits upwards of £100,000 per year from 2005!
            Her goal with the website was to make it "stand out in a sea of same-again car websites"
            Ling is now retired from the business to cycle the world, but her inspiration remains!

            Lily Shears is one of the current Directors of Ling's Cars.
            Having a Bachelor's degree in Arts, Media, Culture and Communications from the University of Sunderland,
            Lily was the main push behind the early 2025 redesign of the site, claiming that, while it had many visitors on account of it's history, not many of those visitors leased a car, making necessary a modernisation of the site
