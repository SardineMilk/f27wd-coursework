    <h1>Commission Disclosure</h1>
    <p>As a credit broker we will receive a commission from one of our finance providers should you decide to enter into an agreement with them because of our introduction. This is reflected in the monthly lease rate that you pay for your vehicle.<br>

Some of the commission we receive is pre-set (a fixed amount agreed in advance and not influenced by any changes you make), and some may be variable (where the amount we receive can vary based on factors such as the type of product, volume, or other commercial agreements).<br>

These payments vary and may also increase the total amount payable, by a customer, on their contract with us, including both initial and monthly rental payments.</p>
      
      <h1>Financial Conduct Authority</h1>
      <p>The Financial Conduct Authority expects any intermediary to disclose to the customer that a commission may be payable by the owner or creditor to the intermediary, and, if the customer asks, the amount of that commission. The Financial Conduct Authority has made it clear that "commission" means any financial consideration. <br>

<b>If you would like us to disclose any potential commission we earn:<br></b>
